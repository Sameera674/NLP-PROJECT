ANALYZING THERAPY SESSIONS

Contributions of the Team Members to the Project

The project, "Analyzing Therapy Sessions," was a team effort that combined individual contributions to create a robust system capable of summarizing therapy sessions and predicting underlying emotional or psychological issues based on conversation data.

Data Collection and Preparation

The first step involved sourcing a comprehensive dataset of therapy session transcripts. All team members collaborated in identifying, collecting, and curating data from multiple sources. Once the data was gathered, the team worked together to concatenate and format it for processing. This foundational effort ensured that the dataset was representative of diverse therapy scenarios, setting the stage for meaningful analysis.

Data Preprocessing - Chandana

Chandana spearheaded the preprocessing phase, a critical step to prepare the raw data for modeling. She cleaned the dataset by removing irrelevant characters, normalizing text, and tokenizing the conversation data. Her work ensured that the input data was consistent and free of noise, enabling the model to focus on meaningful patterns and insights.

Model Development - Sachethan

Sachethan took charge of developing the text classification model using DistilBERT, a state-of-the-art transformer model known for its efficiency and performance. He fine-tuned the model on the processed dataset, enabling it to identify behavioral and emotional patterns in the therapy sessions. By optimizing hyperparameters and incorporating feedback loops, Sachethan ensured the model could accurately predict potential issues discussed during the sessions.

Summarization Feature - Susmitha

Susmitha led the design and implementation of a summarization module to generate concise summaries of therapy conversations. This feature added significant value by providing a quick and insightful overview of lengthy therapy sessions. Her work included selecting suitable summarization algorithms and integrating them into the system, making it user-friendly and efficient.

Testing and Evaluation - Sameera

Sameera focused on testing and evaluating the performance of the system. She rigorously tested the trained DistilBERT model using a different dataset sourced from Hugging Face, ensuring the model's ability to generalize beyond the training data. Her analysis identified key strengths and areas for improvement, resulting in a more reliable and effective system.

Outcome of the Project

Through the combined efforts of the team, the system successfully achieved its goals of:
Generating accurate and concise summaries of therapy sessions, making it easier for practitioners to review key points.
Predicting potential psychological or emotional challenges the individual might be facing, providing deeper insights based on conversational patterns.
This project demonstrates how advanced NLP techniques, combined with strategic teamwork, can offer practical solutions for analyzing and understanding therapy conversations.
